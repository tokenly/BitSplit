                        <p>Create a special token that works within your platform that can only be earned via folding. This helps to incentivize people in our community to be more engaged with your project if there is a token they can only earn via folding.</p>

<!--                         <p>• Rather than creating your own blockchain requiring people to maintain, you can simply use an already existing mining base that chooses to fold for science instead.</p>

                        <p>• If your project is looking for a way to “Airdrop” your token, and you’re not sure who should receive your token, airdropping to those that are using their mining equipment for folding is a great way for your project to help a charity with a good cause at the same time of promoting your own project. This is a win-win situation for our project, yours, and most importantly medical research.</p> -->
